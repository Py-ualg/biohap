#### Outline

1. Pull finished ro-crates 
2. fuseki setup
3. generate a graph
4. basics of SPARQL
5. setup NB for sparQL querries locally
6. Filter the emobon data

#### Pull RO-Crates

A RO-Crate is an integrated view through which you can see an entire Research Object; 
the methods, the data, the output and the outcomes of a project or a piece of work. 
Linking all this together enables the sharing of research outputs with their context, as 
a coherent whole. [https://www.researchobject.org](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/about_ro_crate)

As we are going to work with [EMO-BON](https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon/) metagenomics data, let's download
some of the RO-Crates. They contain only the pointers to the actual data files, so the payload is moderate.


#### fuseki setup
Expose your triples as a SPARQL end-point accessible over HTTP. 
Fuseki provides REST-style interaction with your RDF data.
