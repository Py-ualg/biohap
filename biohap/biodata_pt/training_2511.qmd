This course should give you set of minimal examples on how to generate a knowledge graph from set of RO-Crates, and use it as a sparQL endpoint either directly or using python `rdflib`.

Second part focused on a specific use case of EMO-BON data, the pilot implementation of the Virtual Research Environment is introduced, basic analysis performed, issues reported, extended analysis proposed.

What is omitted here is how to organize the data and build the RO-Crates themselves.

## Environmental setup

This setup serves is ubiquitus for both parts of the tutorial. We will clone two repositories and install one of them. To keep everything exactly the same, we create a designated folder

```bash
mkdir emobon_demo
cd emobon_demo
```

Create a dedicated conda/python environment

```bash
# if you are using conda
conda create -n "emobon" python=3.10  # or higher
conda activate emobon
```

### Python resources

```bash
# create a folder
mkdir momics-demos
cd momics-demos

# clone the repository into newly created folder
git clone https://github.com/emo-bon/momics-demos.git

# step into the repository
cd momics-demos

# install dependencies using pip
pip install -e .

# setup jupyter kernel
ipython kernel install --user --name "emobon"
```

### Backend setup:

As we are going to work with [EMO-BON](https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon/) metagenomics data, one way is to download some of the RO-Crates [GitHub repository](https://github.com/emo-bon/analysis-results-cluster-01-crate) manually.

Easier, however. is to clone the whole repository. Navigate back to the `..../emobon_demo/` and do:

```bash
mkdir ro-crates
cd ro-crates

git clone https://github.com/emo-bon/analysis-results-cluster-01-crate.git
```

As you see in the GH as well, you have now the RO-Crates per sample and corresponding `.ttl` files to simplify your life.

We will use [fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/index.html) server for a SPARQL endpoint. It is a java ndpoint, therefore, you might need to install `java` first if `java -version` command does not return anything or your version is <17.0.

#### Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jre-headless
java -version
```

Here comes the fuseki download itself. Please chose appropriate folder for this. For direct download visit this [page](https://jena.apache.org/download/index.cgi).

```bash
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/jena/binaries/apache-jena-fuseki-5.6.0.tar.gz

# open the archive
tar -xvf apache-jena-fuseki-5.6.0.tar.gz
```
#### Windows

For java, if you have `winget`, you can follow steps [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/install#install-on-windows-with-the-windows-package-manager-winget) (not tested by the authors). Otherwise, download OpenJDK `.exe` file from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download) and install it. You might need to close and reopen the command line window to see the updated version with `java --version` command in your PowerShell.

Download directly the `fuseki` 5.6.0 zip file from [apache](https://jena.apache.org/download/index.cgi) and extract the archive.
