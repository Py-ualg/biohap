This course should give you set of minimal examples on how to generate a knowldge graph 
from set of RO-Crates, and query against it using SPARQL or python `rdflib`.

In the second part focused on a specific use case of EMO-BON data, the pilot implementation of the
Virtual Research Environment is introduced. 

What is omitted here is how to organize the data and build the RO-Crates themselves.
