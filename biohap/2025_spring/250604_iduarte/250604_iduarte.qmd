# RNA-seq Analysis Crash Course

Welcome! This crash course walks you through RNA-seq data analysis in R: From raw count matrices to functional interpretation of differentially expressed genes.

### Learning Objectives

1.  Perform quality control of the data.
2.  Identify the R commands needed to run a differential expression analysis using `edgeR` and `DESeq2`.
3.  Visualize the DE results.
4.  Undertake functional annotation of data, and perform functional enrichment analysis.
5.  Visualize functionally enriched biological categories.

### **Theory**

RNA-seq is a leading method for quantifying RNA levels in biological samples, leveraging next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. The process begins with RNA extraction and conversion to cDNA, followed by sequencing to produce reads representing the RNA present in a sample. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### RNA-seq Overview

These data are processed through a standard workflow with three main stages, as summarized in the figure below:

1.  **Data pre-processing** – improves read quality by removing contaminants and adapters.
2.  **Alignment and quantification** – maps reads to a reference genome and estimates gene expression, either through traditional or faster lightweight methods.
3.  **Differential expression analysis** – identifies and visualizes genes with significant expression differences.

Additional downstream analyses (e.g., functional enrichment, co-expression, or multi-omics integration) are popular ways to derive biological insights from these analyses.

![Adapted from: <https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/dev/docs/usage/differential_expression_analysis/theory>](figs/rna-seq_course.png)

This course will not cover the first two steps. It will begin with a gene count matrix and proceed with differential expression analysis, visualization, and a brief overview of functional enrichment.

#### Differential Expression

Differential expression (DE) analysis compares gene expression levels across conditions (e.g., disease vs. healthy) to identify genes with statistically significant changes. This is typically done using tools like **DESeq2**, a robust R package designed for analyzing RNA-seq count data.



1.  **Input Requirements**:

    -   A **count matrix** (genes × samples).
    -   A **metadata table** describing sample attributes.

2.  **Quality Control**:

    -   Use **PCA** and **hierarchical clustering** to explore variation and detect outliers.
    -   Transform counts using **variance stabilizing transformation (vst)** or **regularized log (rlog)** to ensure comparable variance across genes, improving downstream analysis.

3.  **Filtering**:

    -   Remove genes with low or zero counts to improve sensitivity and reduce false positives.

4.  **Design Formula**:

    -   Specifies how gene counts depend on experimental factors.

    -   Can include main conditions and covariates (e.g., sex, batch, stage).

    -   Example:

        ``` r
        design = ~ condition
        design = ~ sex + developmental_stage + condition
        ```

    -   The main factor of interest is usually placed last for clarity.


##### DE with DESeq2

DESeq2 is a widely used R package for identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes from RNA-seq count data. RNA-seq data typically exhibit many low-count genes and a long-tailed distribution due to highly expressed genes, requiring specialized statistical modeling. The major steps in DESeq2 are the following:

1. **Normalization**

   * Adjusts for sequencing depth and RNA composition using **size factors** calculated via the median ratio method.
   * Normalized counts are used for visualization but **raw counts must be used for DESeq2 modeling**.

2. **Dispersion Estimation**

   * RNA-seq data show **overdispersion** (variance > mean).
   * DESeq2 models count data using the **negative binomial distribution**.
   * Dispersion is estimated:

     * Globally (common dispersion),
     * Per gene (gene-wise dispersion),
     * Then refined through **shrinkage toward a fitted mean-dispersion curve** to improve stability, especially with small sample sizes.
   * Genes with extreme variability are **not shrunk** to avoid false positives.

3. **Model Fitting and Hypothesis Testing**

   * A **generalized linear model (GLM)** is fit to each gene’s normalized counts.
   * DESeq2 tests whether gene expression differs significantly between groups:

     * **Wald test** for simple comparisons (e.g., treated vs. control),
     * **Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)** for more complex designs with multiple variables.
   * Each test returns a **log2 fold change** and a **p-value**.

4. **Multiple Testing Correction**

   * To control for false positives from testing thousands of genes, DESeq2 adjusts p-values using **Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction**.
   * An FDR cutoff of <0.05 means that 5% of DE genes may be false positives.

#### Functional Analysis

After identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes, **functional analysis** helps interpret their biological relevance by uncovering the pathways, processes, or interactions they may be involved in. This includes:

* **Functional enrichment analysis** – identifies overrepresented biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, or pathways.
* **Network analysis** – groups genes with similar expression patterns to reveal potential interactions.

This course focuses on **Over-Representation Analysis (ORA)**, a common enrichment method that uses the **hypergeometric test** to assess whether certain biological pathways or gene sets are statistically enriched in the DE gene list.

Key components of ORA:

* **Universe** – the full set of genes considered (e.g., all genes in the genome).
* **Gene Set** – a group of genes annotated to a particular function or pathway (e.g., from Gene Ontology).
* **Gene List** – the list of DE genes identified in the analysis.

The test evaluates whether the overlap between the DE gene list and a gene set exceeds what would be expected by chance, pointing to potentially meaningful biological mechanisms.

Tools commonly used for functional enrichment include **Gene Ontology**, **KEGG**, **Reactome**, **clusterProfiler**, and **g\:Profiler**. These support the biological interpretation of DE results and help uncover pathways affected by the experimental condition.

#### Quality control

##### Setup

1.  Load packages and data

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load required packages
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(edgeR)
library(limma)
library(DESeq2)

# Create list to save the analysis objects
de_edger <- list()
de_deseq <- list()

# Load gene counts data and sample metadata
counts <- readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("2025_spring/250604_iduarte/data/diet_mice_counts.xlsx"), col_names = TRUE, sheet = 1)

metadata <- read.table(file=here::here("2025_spring/250604_iduarte/data/diet_mice_metadata.txt"), 
                        header = TRUE,

                        stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

```

2.  Check if the data and metadata sample ids match

```{r}
#| eval: true

### Ensure the sample metadata matches the identity and order of the columns in the expression data

# Order the sample ids from the metadata (smaller file) by the colnames from the counts
if (setequal(colnames(counts)[-c(1, 2)], metadata$sample_id)) {
  metadata <- metadata[match(colnames(counts)[-c(1, 2)], metadata$sample_id),]
} else {
  stop("Error: The set of sample ids is not equal in both datasets.")
}

```

3.  Tidy the data

```{r}
#| eval: true

# Transform count data-frame to matrix with row names
# and remove NAs (if they exist)
counts_matrix <- counts[-1] %>%
na.omit() %>%
column_to_rownames(var = "gene_symbol") %>%
as.matrix()
```

4.  PCA \| validation of experimental design

5.  Hierarchical clustering of the correlation matrix

#### Differential expression

1.  edgeR analysis

Create design and contrast matrices \| Modelling Diet and Gender

```{r}
#| eval: true

# Design matrix using the model for categorical variables diet and gender
design_diet <- model.matrix( ~ 0 + diet + gender, data = metadata)
#design_diet <- model.matrix( ~ 0 + diet, data = metadata)

# Contrasts matrix: Differences between diets
contrasts_diet <- limma::makeContrasts(
(dietfat - dietlean),
levels=colnames(design_diet)
)

```

2.  Extract differentially expressed genes

```{r}
#| eval: true

# Create a list 

# Create a DGEList object
de_edger$dge_data <- DGEList(counts = counts_matrix)

# Filter low-expression genes
de_edger$keep <- filterByExpr(de_edger$dge_data,
design = design_diet)

de_edger$dge_data_filtered <- de_edger$dge_data[de_edger$keep, , 
                                                keep.lib.sizes=FALSE]

# Perform Library Size Normalization | Slow step
de_edger$dge_data_filtered <- calcNormFactors(de_edger$dge_data_filtered)

# Estimate dispersions | Slow step
de_edger$dge_data_filtered <- estimateDisp(de_edger$dge_data_filtered,
design = design_diet)

### To perform likelihood ratio tests
# Fit the negative binomial generalized log-linear model
de_edger$fit <- glmFit(de_edger$dge_data_filtered,
design=design_diet,
contrast = contrasts_diet)

# Perform likelihood ratio tests
de_edger$lrt <- glmLRT(de_edger$fit)

# Extract the differentially expressed genes
de_edger$topGenes <- topTags(de_edger$lrt, n=NULL,
adjust.method = "BH", 
sort.by = "PValue", 
p.value = 0.05)

# Look at the Differentially expressed genes
de_edger$topGenes

```

3.  DESeq2 analysis

Detailed explanations can be found [here.](https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop_salmon_online/lessons/04b_DGE_DESeq2_analysis.html)

```{r}
#| warning: false

# Step 1: Create a DESeqDataSet object
# The matrix is generated by the function
de_deseq$dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts_matrix,
                              colData = metadata,
                              design = ~ 0 + diet + gender)

# Step 2: Run the DESeq function to perform the analysis
de_deseq$dds <- DESeq(de_deseq$dds)

# Step 3: Extract results
# Replace 'condition_treated_vs_untreated' with the actual comparison you are interested in
de_deseq$results <- results(de_deseq$dds, contrast = c("diet", "fat", "lean"))

# Step 4: Apply multiple testing correction
# The results function by default applies the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control FDR
# Extract results with adjusted p-value (padj) less than 0.05 (common threshold for significance)
de_deseq$significant_results <- de_deseq$results[which(de_deseq$results$padj < 0.05), ]

# View the differentially expressed genes
de_deseq$significant_results[order(de_deseq$significant_results$padj), ]

```

### **Tutorial NF-core**


#### Differential Expression Analysis with DESeq2

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the practical steps necessary to set up the RStudio project, load the required libraries and data, execute the DESeq2 analysis, and a final simple functional enrichment analysis. 

Reference: <https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.18.0/docs/usage/deanalysis/de_rstudio>

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### 1. Setup

As with any analysis, the first step is to create a folder to store your work.

1. Choose an appropriate location on your computer, then set up the following folder structure:

```
  rnaseq_counts2bio_course/    
  ├── data/    
  ├── scripts/    
  ├── de_results/    
  └── sandbox/   
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Tip: Set Up a Clear Folder Structure Early"}

Before collecting data, define a clear folder structure and file naming convention. This improves organization, avoids confusion, and supports collaboration. A consistent setup helps you and your team quickly locate and understand files.

Start organized - your future self (and collaborators) will thank you!

Suggested *minimal* structure for a data analysis project:

```
project_name_no_spaces_no_special_chars/    
├── data/            # Raw and processed data
│   ├── raw/         
│   └── processed/   
├── scripts/         # Analysis and processing code
├── output/          # Figures, tables, results
└── sandbox/         # Exploratory work (not for sharing)
```
:::

2. Create a new RStudio project inside the `rnaseq_counts2bio_course` folder:

2.1 Go to the **File** menu and select **New Project**;

2.2 Select **New Directory**, **New Project**, name the project as shown below and click on **Create Project**;

The new project will be automatically opened in RStudio.

We can check whether we are in the correct working directory with `getwd()`. 

Next, go to the **File menu**, select **New File** and then **R Script** to create a script editor in which we will save all commands required for the analysis. In the editor type:

```{r start}

#### Differential expression analysis with DESeq2 ####

```

and save the file as `de_script.R` inside the `scripts` folder. From now on, each command described in the course can be added to your script. 

The analysis requires several R packages. To use them, we need to load the following libraries:

```r
#### Loading libraries ####

# tidyverse: collection of R packages for data manipulation, visualization and modeling

library("tidyverse")

# DESeq2: package for differential gene expression analysis

library("DESeq2")

# pheatmap: package for creating heatmaps, which will be used to visualise the results

library("pheatmap")

# RColorBrewer: package for creating color palettes, which will be used to customise the heatmaps

library("RColorBrewer")

# ggrepel: package that provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels in the plots

library("ggrepel")
```

and the pre-computed DESeq2 object (`dds`) generated by the nfcore/rnaseq pipeline. In this tutorial we will analyse the `dds` object generated by running the alignment with **STAR** and the quantification with **Salmon**:

```r
#### Import the dds obtained from nfcore/rnaseq ####

load("/workspace/gitpod/training/results_star_salmon/star_salmon/deseq2_qc/deseq2.dds.RData")
```

Alternatively, a user could choose to analyse the the `dds` object generated by running only **Salmon** for both lightweight alignment and quantification.

In DESEq2, the `dds` object is a central data structure that contains the following components:

- `countData`: a matrix of raw count data, where each row represents a gene and each column represents a sample;

- `colData`: a data frame containing information about the samples, such as the experimental design, treatment and other relevant metadata;

- `design`: a formula specifying the experimental design utilised to estimate the dispersion and the log2 fold change.

All these components can be checked with specific commands:

```r
#### dds inspection ####

head(counts(dds)) # to check the raw counts

colData(dds) # to check the sample info

design(dds) # to check the design formula
```

The `colData` and the `design` are the ones created within the nfcore/rnaseq pipeline and must be reorganised prior to the analysis. With the following commands we will create our metadata starting from the info stored in the `dds`. We will rename the column of the `colData`, we will ensure that the rownames of the metadata are present in the same order as the column names and finally we will update the `colData` of the `dds` object with our newly created metadata.

```r
#### Creation of metadata starting from the dds colData ####

metadata <- DataFrame(
    sample = colData(dds)$sample,
    condition = colData(dds)$Group1,
    replica = colData(dds)$Group2
)

# Assign names to rows of metadata

rownames(metadata) <- colnames(counts(dds))

# Fill the dds colData with the generated metadata

colData(dds) <- metadata
```

To avoid errors in DESeq2 is essential to check that sample names match between the `colData` and the `countData`, and that the sample are in the correct order:

```r
#### Check that sample names match in both files ####

all(colnames(dds$counts) %in% rownames(metadata)) # Must be TRUE

all(colnames(dds$counts) == rownames(metadata)) # Must be TRUE
```

Now that everything is setted up, we can proceed to generate a new DESeq2 object with the corrected metadata and the right design:

```r
#### Creation of a new dds ####

dds_new  <- DESeqDataSet(dds, design = ~ condition)

# dds inspection

head(counts(dds_new)) # to check the raw counts

colData(dds_new) # to check the sample info

design(dds_new) # to check the design formula
```

Before running the different steps of the analysis, a good practice consists in pre-filtering the genes to remove those with very low counts. This is useful to improve computational efficiency and enhance interpretability. In general, it is reasonable to keep only genes with a sum counts of at least 10 for a minimal number of 3 samples:

```r
#### Pre-filtering ####

# Select a minimal number of samples = 3

smallestGroupSize <- 3

# Select genes with a sum counts of at least 10 in 3 samples

keep <- rowSums(counts(dds_new) >= 10) >= smallestGroupSize

# Keep only the genes that pass the threshold

dds_filtered <- dds_new[keep,]
```

Now, it is time to run the differential expression analysis with the `DESeq()` function:

```r
#### Run the DESeq2 analysis ####

dds_final <- DESeq(dds_filtered)
```

The `DESeq()` function is a high-level wrapper that simplifies the process of differential expression analysis by combining multiple steps into a single function call. This makes the workflow more user-friendly and ensures that all necessary pre-processing and statistical steps are executed in the correct order. The key functions that **DESeq2** calls include:

- `estimateSizeFactors`: to normalise the count data;

- `estimateDispersion`: to estimate the dispersion;

- `nbinomWaldTest`: to perform differential expression test.

The individual functions can be carried out also singularly as shown below:

```r
#### Differential expression analysis step-by-step ####

dds_final <- estimateSizeFactors(dds_filtered)

dds_final <- estimateDispersions(dds_final)

dds_final <- nbinomWaldTest(dds_final)
```

#### 2. Quality control 

The next step in the DESeq2 workflow is to perform quality control (QC) analysis on our data. This analysis is crucial for identifying potential issues ensuring that the data are suitable for downstream analysis. For QC analysis, it is useful to work with transformed versions of the count data, `variance-stabilised (vst)` or `regularised log-transformed (rlog)` counts. While, the rlog is more robust to outliers and extreme values, vst is computationally faster and so preferred for larger dataset.


::: {.callout-warning}
These transformations are used for visualisation purposes, while DESeq2 requires raw counts (non- normalized (i.e., not TPMs, RPKMs, FPKMs, ...)) for differential expression analysis.
:::


```r
#### Transform normalised counts for data visualisation ####
# A user can choose among vst and rlog. In this tutorial we will work with rlog transformed data.

rld <- rlog(dds_final, blind = TRUE)
```

The `rlog` and the `vst` transformations have an argument, **blind** that can be set to:

- **TRUE** (default): useful for QC analysis because it re-estimates the dispersion, allowing for comparison of samples in an unbiased manner with respect to experimental conditions;

- **FALSE**: the function utilizes the already estimated dispersion, generally applied when differences in counts are expected to be due to the experimental design.

Next, we perform **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to explore the data. DESeq2 provides a built-in function, `plotPCA()`, which uses [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) for visualisation, taking the `rld` (or the `vst`) object as input.
Since the **treatment** is the principal condition of interest in our metadata, we will use the `condition` information from our metadata to plot the PCA:

```r
#### Plot PCA ####

pca_plot <- plotPCA(rld, intgroup = "condition")

# Save the plot

ggsave("de_results/pca_plot.png", plot = pca_plot, width = 6, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

The second essential step in QC analysis is **Hierarchical Clustering**. Although DESeq2 does not have a built-in function for this analysis, we can use the `pheatmap()` function from the **pheatmap** package.
We will extract the matrix of rlog-transformed counts from the `rld` object (pheatmap input), compute pairwise correlations and plot the heatmap:

```r
#### Plot sample to sample distance (hierarchical clustering) ####

# Extract the matrix of rlog-transformed counts from the rld object

sampleDists <- dist(t(assay(rld)))  # Calculate pairwise distances between samples using the dist() function with Euclidean distance as the default method. By transposing the matrix with t(), we ensure that samples become rows and genes become columns, so that the dist function computes pairwise distances between samples.

# Convert distances to a matrix

sampleDistMatrix <- as.matrix(sampleDists)

# Set the row and column names of the distance matrix

rownames(sampleDistMatrix) <- paste(rld$condition, rld$replica, sep = "_")

colnames(sampleDistMatrix) <- paste(rld$condition, rld$replica, sep = "_")

# Define a color palette for the heatmap

colors <- colorRampPalette(rev(brewer.pal(9, "Greens")))(255) # function from RColorBrewer package

# Create the heatmap

clustering_plot <- pheatmap(sampleDistMatrix,
                            clustering_distance_rows = sampleDists,
                            clustering_distance_cols = sampleDists,
                            col = colors,
                            fontsize_col = 8,
                            fontsize_row = 8)

# Save the plot

ggsave("de_results/clustering_plot.png", plot = clustering_plot, width = 6, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

The normalised counts stored in the `dds` can be inspected with the `counts()` function and saved in our de_results folder:

```r
#### Inspect the normalised counts ####

# Display the first few rows of the normalised counts to inspect the data

head(counts(dds_final, normalized = TRUE))

# Display the first few rows of the raw counts (not normalised) to compare with the normalised counts

head(counts(dds_final))

# Convert the normalised counts from the DESeq2 object to a tibble

normalised_counts <- as_tibble(counts(dds_final, normalized = TRUE))

# Add a column for gene names to the normalised counts tibble

normalised_counts$gene <- rownames(counts(dds_final))

# Relocate the gene column to the first position

normalised_counts <- normalised_counts %>%
  relocate(gene, .before = control_rep1)

# Save the normalised counts

write.csv(normalised_counts, file = "de_results/normalised_counts.csv")
```

The `results()` function in DESeq2 is used to extract the results of the DE analysis. This function takes the `dds` object as input and returns a DataFrame containing the results of the analysis:

- **baseMean**: the average expression level of the gene across all samples;

- **log2FoldChange**: the log2 fold change of the gene between the condition of interest and the reference level;

- **lfcSE**: the standard error of the log2 fold change;

- **stat**: the Wald statistic, which is used to calculate the p-value;

- **pvalue**: the p-value from the Wald test indicates the probability of observing the measured difference in gene expression (log2 fold change) by chance, assuming no true difference exists (null hypothesis). A low p-value suggests that the observed expression change between samples is unlikely due to random chance, so we can reject the null hypothesis --> the gene is differentially expressed;

- **padj**: the adjusted p-value, which takes into account multiple testing corrections, (Benjamini-Hochberg method default) to control the false discovery rate;

The `results()` function returns the results for all genes in the analysis with an adjusted p-value below a specific FDR cutoff, set by default to 0.1. This threshold can be modified with the parameter `alpha`. The `results()` function can also be customised to filter the results based on certain criteria (log2 fold change or padj) or to set a specific contrast (specific comparison between two or more levels).

::: {.callout-important}
The order of the contrast names determines the direction of the fold change that is reported in the results. Specifically, the first level of the contrast is the condition of interest and the second level is the reference level.
:::

Notice that in this tutorial the contrast is already correctly specified.

```r
#### Extract results table from the dds object ####

res <- results(dds_final)

# Visualise the results

head(res)

# Summarise the results showing the number of tested genes (genes with non-zero total read count), the genes up- and down-regulated at the selected threshold (alpha) and the number of genes excluded by the multiple testing due to a low mean count

summary(res)

# DESeq2 function to extract the name of the contrast

resultsNames(dds_final)

# res <- results(dds, contrast = c("design_formula", "condition_of_interest", "reference_condition"))
# Command to set the contrast, if necessary

# Store the res object inside another variable because the original res file will be required for other functions

res_viz <- res

# Add gene names as a new column to the results table

res_viz$gene <- rownames(res)

# Convert the results to a tibble for easier manipulation and relocate the gene column to the first position

res_viz <- as_tibble(res_viz) %>%
  relocate(gene, .before = baseMean)

# Save the results table

write.csv(res_viz, file = "de_results/de_result_table.csv")
```

In the _Experimental Design_ section, we emphasised the importance of estimating the log2 fold change threshold using a statistical power calculation, rather than selecting it arbitrarily. This approach ensures that the chosen threshold is statistically appropriate and tailored to the specifics of the experiment. However, since we are working with simulated data for demonstration purposes, we will use a padj threshold of 0.05 and consider genes with a log2 fold change of at least 1 or -1 as differentially expressed.

```r
#### Extract significant DE genes from the results ####

# Filter the results to include only significantly DE genes with a padj less than 0.05 and a log2FoldChange of at least 1 or -1

resSig <- subset(res_viz, padj < 0.05 & abs(log2FoldChange) > 1)

# Convert the results to a tibble for easier manipulation and relocate the gene column to the first position

resSig <- as_tibble(resSig) %>%
  relocate(gene, .before = baseMean)

# Order the significant genes by their adjusted p-value (padj) in ascending order

resSig <- resSig[order(resSig$padj),]

# Display the final results table of significant genes

resSig

# Save the significant DE genes

write.csv(resSig, file = "de_results/sig_de_genes.csv")
```

#### 3. Visualise the results

Now that we have obtained the results of the differential expression analysis, it's time to visualise the data to gain a deeper understanding of the biological processes that are affected by the experimental conditions. Visualisation is a crucial step in RNA-seq analysis, as it allows us to identify patterns and trends in the data that may not be immediately apparent from the numerical results.

In the following sections, we will explore different types of plots that are commonly used to visualise the results of RNA-seq analysis, including:

- **MA plot**: scatter plot commonly utilised to visualise the results of the DE analysis for all the samples. The plot displays the mean of the normalised counts on the x-axis and the log2 fold change on the y-axis. This allows the visualisation of the relationship between the magnitude of the fold change and the mean expression level of the genes. Genes that are differentially expressed will appear farthest from the horizontal line, while genes with low expression levels will appear closer to the line.

```r
#### MA plot ####

# The MA plot is not a ggplot, so we have to save it in a different way

# Open a graphics device to save the plot as a PNG file

png("MA_plot.png", width = 1500, height = 100, res = 300)

# Generate the MA plot (it will be saved to the file instead of displayed on screen)

plotMA(res, ylim = c(-2, 2))

# Close the device to save the file

dev.off()
```

- **counts plot**: plot of the normalised counts for a single gene across the different conditions in your experiment. It’s particularly useful for visualising the expression levels of specific genes of interest and comparing them across sample groups.

```r
#### Plot a specific gene in this case ENSG00000142192, a DE gene ####

png("de_results/plotCounts.png", width = 1000, height = 1200, res = 300)

plotCounts(dds_final, gene = "ENSG00000142192")

dev.off()
```

**heatmap**: plot of the normalised counts for all the significant genes obtained with the `pheatmap()` function. The heatmap provides insights into genes and sample relationships that may not be apparent from individual gene plots alone.

```r
#### Heatmap ####

# Extract only the first column (gene names) from the result object containing the significant genes

significant_genes <- resSig[, 1]

# Extract normalised counts for significant genes from the normalised counts matrix and convert the gene column to row names

significant_counts <- inner_join(normalised_counts, significant_genes, by = "gene") %>%
  column_to_rownames("gene")

# Create the heatmap using pheatmap

heatmap <- pheatmap(significant_counts,
                    cluster_rows = TRUE,
                    fontsize = 8,
                    scale = "row",
                    fontsize_row = 8,
                    height = 10)

# Save the plot

ggsave("de_results/heatmap.png", plot = heatmap, width = 6, height = 5, dpi = 300)

```

- **volcano plot**: scatter plot that displays the log2 fold change on the x-axis and the log transformed padj on the y-axis. This allows for the visualisation of both the magnitude and significance of the changes in gene expression between two conditions. Genes that are differentially expressed (i.e., have a large log2 fold change) and are statistically significant (i.e., have a low padj) will appear in the left (downregulated genes) or in the right (upregulated genes) corners of the plot making easier their identification.

```r
#### Volcano plot ####

# Convert the results to a tibble and add a column indicating differential expression status

res_tb <- as_tibble(res) %>%
  mutate(diffexpressed = case_when(
    log2FoldChange > 1 & padj < 0.05 ~ 'upregulated',
    log2FoldChange < -1 & padj < 0.05 ~ 'downregulated',
    TRUE ~ 'not_de'))

# Add a new column with gene names

res_tb$gene <- rownames(res)

# Relocate the gene column to the first position

res_tb <-  res_tb %>%
  relocate(gene, .before = baseMean)

# Order the table by padj and add a new column for gene labels

res_tb <- res_tb %>% arrange(padj) %>%
  mutate(genelabels = "")

# Label the top 5 most significant genes

res_tb$genelabels[1:5] <- res_tb$gene[1:5]

# Create a volcano plot using ggplot2

volcano_plot <- ggplot(data = res_tb, aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = -log10(padj), col = diffexpressed)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.6) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = genelabels), size = 2.5, max.overlaps = Inf) +
  ggtitle("DE genes treatment versus control") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-1, 1), col = "black", linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), col = "black", linetype = 'dashed', linewidth = 0.2) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.25), hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(size = rel(1))) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("upregulated" = "red",
                                "downregulated" = "blue",
                                "not_de" = "grey")) +
  labs(color = 'DE genes') +
  xlim(-3,5)

# Save the plot

ggsave("de_results/volcano_plot.png", plot = volcano_plot, width = 6, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

#### 4. Functional analysis

The output of the differential expression analysis is a list of significant DE genes. To uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, various downstream analyses can be performed, such as functional enrichment analysis (identify overrepresented biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components or pathways), and network analysis (group genes based on similar expression patterns to identify novel interactions). To facilitate the interpretation of the resulting list of DE genes, a range of freely available web- and R-based tools can be employed.

In this tutorial, we will explore an enrichment analysis technique known as Over-Representation Analysis (ORA), a powerful tool for identifying biological pathways or processes significantly enriched within the list of DE genes. The underlying statistic behind ORA is the **hypergeometric test**, which considers three key components:

- **Universe**: the background list of genes (for example the genes annotated in a genome);

- **GeneSet**: a collection of genes annotated by a reference database (such as Gene Ontology), and known to be involved in a particular biological pathway or process;

- **Gene List**: the differentially expressed genes.

The hypergeometric test calculates the probability of observing a certain number of genes from the gene set (pathway or process) within the gene list (DE genes) by chance.
An important aspect of this analysis is the concept of **membership**. It defines the relationship between DE genes and genes from the analysed gene set. By knowing which genes belong to which pathway/process, we can determine whether the observed overlap between DE genes and the particular pathway/process is greater than what would be expected by random chance.
