Introduction to RNA-seq data analysis using R, focusing on differential expression analysis and learning
how to choose the right Generalized linear model (GLM) for your question and your data. Participants will 
learn essential concepts and basic workflow, from preprocessing raw count data to identifying differentially 
expressed genes.
