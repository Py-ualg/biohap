# RNA-Seq Data Analysis in R - From Counts to Biological Insights

    Introduction to RNA-seq data analysis using R, focusing on differential expression analysis and learning
    how to choose the right Generalized linear model (GLM) for your question and your data. Participants will 
    learn essential concepts and basic workflow, from preprocessing raw count data to identifying differentially 
    expressed genes.
