# Introduction

three hands-on workshops designed to equip researchers with essential data analysis
skills for bioinformatics. Every month, you will get served a workshop which cover
a key aspect of biological data analysis, from RNA-seq to microbiome analysis,
helping you turn raw sequence files into meaningful biological insights. 

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.
