- üóì Date: May 7, 2025, 15:00 - 17:00 (help with technical setup at 14:30)
- üìç Location: CCMAR, Gambelas, building 7, room 1.39.

This workshop will provide an overview of microbiome data analysis from Illumina amplicon sequencing raw data to data processing, visualization and statistics. Participants will learn basic concepts and tools to preprocess (QIIME2) and analyse (MicrobiomeAnalyst, Phyloseq) microbiome data, in particular bacteria associated with marine organisms.

**Coverage**: QIIME2, MicrobiomeAnalyst

**Requirements**: HPC account (contact David) for running QIIME2, R studio for Phyloseq.
